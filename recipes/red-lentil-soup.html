    <h3 class="header">Description</h3>
    <p class="desc">This soup is divine and much like you will get at any authentic Turkish restaurant. 
      It has dynamic flavors and a lovely mild heat. I make a big batch and eat it 
      for lunch with crusty bread and salad the entire week. Optional: Serve with 
      additional mint and lemon wedges.</p>
  
    <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>½ onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¼ cup diced tomatoes, drained</li>
      <li>5 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>½ cup red lentils</li>
      <li>¼ cup fine bulgur</li>
      <li>¼ cup rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Cook and stir the onion 
        in the hot oil until it begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir the garlic into 
        the onion and cook another 2 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes to the onion mixture; 
        continue to cook and stir another 10 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Pour in the chicken stock, red lentils, bulgur, rice, tomato paste, paprika, 
        cayenne pepper, and mint to the tomato mixture; season with salt and black pepper. 
        Bring the soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the lentils 
        and rice are cooked through, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Pour the soup into a blender to no more than half full. Firmly hold the lid 
        in place and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup 
        moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth; pour into 
        your serving dish. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and 
        puree the soup in cooking pot.</p></li>
