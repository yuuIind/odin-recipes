    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This manti recipe takes a little time to prepare, but I'm sure 
      you'll agree it's worth it! Manti is a famous meal from my country. 
      Afiyet olsun!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
      <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 container plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and water, 
        mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. 
        Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain 
        and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper 
        in a large bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</p></li>
      <li><p>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</p></li>
      <li><p>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough 
        on the floured surface into a rectangle, as thin as you can. Cut into 2-inch squares 
        with a knife or pastry wheel.</p></li>
      <li><p>Place about 2 teaspoons meat filling in the center of each square. 
        Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. 
        Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</p></li>
      <li><p>Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until 
        pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm. Stir together yogurt 
        and minced garlic in a small bowl and set aside.</p></li>
      <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in 
        boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. 
        Drain well.</p></li>
      <li><p>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle each 
        serving with warm red pepper oil.</p></li>
